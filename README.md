# InsightsShare Android Application Testing

The InsightsShare application is designed for users with interests in various fields of studies irrespective of their opportunity to study in an educational institution. They can share their knowledge or participate in a variety of user made events to broaden their horizon. The application provides a platform for people to host and organize events, where they can exchange their knowledge.

Fork:
As this repository will be part of a study project, where we are adding automatic tests to an existing project, [InsightsShare-app](https://github.com/InsightsShare/InsightsShare-app) has been forked, to avoid any changes being made unbeknownst to us, while we are working on the project.
